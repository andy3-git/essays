What Is A Computer

  From prior experience with computers, to me a computer is a machine that operates on both hardware and software. 
Hardware being items such as motherboards, cooling fans, graphics cards, etc. But what distinguishes a computer from other machines is the user interface. 
In physics I learned that other machines such as pulleys, wheels, levers, and elevators are a force multiplier that decreases the amount of force needed to lift a heavy object. 
These machines are found everywhere such as elevators, cars, shopping carts, etc. But the key difference between these machines and a computer is the User Interface. 
Machines are linear, wheels can only roll, pulleys can only pull an object, meaning that they respond to only one kind of input. 
A computer however can be used for a variety of functions such as calculating numbers, drawing graphs that represent all kinds of data, encrypting and decrypting data, programming, the amount of use that a computer has is universal and that is what distinguishes a computer from any other machine.  

 
  I remember my first experience with a computer back in Middle School. 
We had a big Mac monitor set up in the living room with a small keyboard and a mouse. 
Me and my brother shared that computer, usually my bigger brother would take control of the computer and from there we would be watching Youtube videos for various topics. 
Unlike the other machines and toys around at the time, I was captivated by how interactive it was. 
It was unlike any other toy I had at the time. The computer had more options, every input led to several different outcomes. 
The action figures that my cousin had at the end of the day were just action figures, and the nerf guns whilst fun only served one purpose which was to shoot and reload. 
But the computer could serve different purposes. 
Whether to communicate with someone from across the island, receive information from various news channels, a sandbox to manipulate through the use of programming, or to play video games with people around the world. 
The options were limitless, and is what drew me into Computer Science. 


  With this definition in mind, I think that devices such as phones, consoles, and GPS systems are computers. 
This is because they contain an interface which inputs leads to many different options that non-computers lack. 
Furthermore, Iâ€™d like to add that being able to execute an algorithm is what separates a computer from a simple machine as well as being able to harbor data structures. 
By this definition, Alexa fits as a computer as the AI supports many different inputs and must be able to run algorithms that translate dialogue into commands that the program can execute.
