Beginnings With TypeScript

Impressions About Typescript

	My current impression as a beginner of Typescript is that it feels familiar. 
 This is because I had experience with Eclipse IDE that we were required to download during ICS 111 at UH Manoa. 
 The programming language that Eclipse utilized was Java, which is similar to Javascript and typescript but different enough to mess with me. 
 Typescript is far more simple than C and C++ so it’s easier to learn than those programming languages. 
 Honestly when I was looking at how types are declared in functions and how the return type was determined I was incredibly confused. 
 But after doing the first credited WOD, I can see that Typescript is not so different in syntax than Java is. F
 or those that don’t know, a ‘WOD’ stands for Workout Of the Day (I’ll be abbreviating this to ‘WOD’ from this point forward). 
 WODs in ICS 314, essentially functions as a quiz that starts at the beginning of class once per week which asks you to code a solution to scenarios or questions most interviewers ask.  


Impressions About WODs

	Prior to the main WOD I was afraid of failing due to a variety of factors. 
 One, I was not confident in my ability to code under a timer due to my difficulty in understanding syntax in most languages, the second reason is that points were at stake, and the final reason was that I had been unable to complete the group WOD (I was incorrect due to being unaware of union return types) and the Euler Problem WOD (I gave up due to lack of understanding of maps). 
 However, after doing the current WOD, I now find the practice WODs to be useful because they helped prepare me for the actual WOD despite how frustrated I felt attempting them. 
 I found the pressure of completing the WOD on time before 20 minutes was over fun. 
 It was relieving when the WOD was over, whether I succeeded or not.


Impressions About Type Of Learning

	For me, I find this way of learning to be more effective than just simply staring at a couple of presentation slides as It keeps me engaged and actively thinking. 
 Although this type of learning utilizing WODs can be stressful, I would say that stress contributes to my learning far more than other styles of teaching because my grade was at stake. 
 Being allowed to use search engines (in the middle of the WOD) such as Google to help with understanding and writing the code allowed us to focus on solving the solutions instead of memorizing the syntax. 


Wrapping Up

	In case this document was too long to read. 
 My initial points were that Typescript was a simple programming language that holds similarity to languages such as Java and Javascript but felt that the syntax was different enough to leave me confused. 
 I then went on my impressions of WODs and stated that while stressful, it was enjoyable and relieving due to the adrenaline of writing a program moments away from the deadline and the pressure lifting when either the program works or time is up. 
 Finally, I felt that this type of learning, utilizing WODs to exercise coding to be more engaging and effective due to how much more involved it was and that search engines were allowed to help with coding and understanding.
