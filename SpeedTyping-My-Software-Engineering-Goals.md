Interests In Software Engineering

Interests
 
 My field of study in ICS is cybersecurity, which is a discipline that focuses on network security, encryption, decryption, etc. 
As of writing this essay I am taking a course at UH Manoa called ICS 314, which is Software Engineering. 
From what I heard from others, this class is difficult and caused many tears to flow. 
While I may not learn specifically about cybersecurity in this course. 
Learning Software Engineering will build a solid foundation and help develop technical skills that will last throughout my career. 
After graduating at UH Manoa, my aspirations are to develop my skills in Cyber Security further by joining an industry or internship that has an emphasis on Cybersecurity.  

Skills
	
 The skills that I hope to develop is an understanding of core computing languages as well as the ability to design efficient algorithms. 
As of now, the computing languages we have gone over in this course were Javascript and typescript, although I had some experience in Python, Java, and C. 
The goal is to learn developmental practices for an industry such as proper testing, debugging, and secure coding practices. 
Furthermore, throughout Software Engineering, soft skills such as problem-solving, time management, collaboration, and communication will continue as we delve further into the journey of Software Engineering. 

Experiences

Besides joining an Internship or an entry-level job, There are more ways for me to gain more experience in the industry. 
For example, I could join Hackathons or other forms of competition that tests my capabilities in the field, playing capture the flag with other cybersecurity people, joining a platform to practice the skill set, or I can practice by attempting to hack into my refrigerator. 
The possibilities to gain experience are endless, but the main idea is to network with other people in this field. 
The more connections, the better probability of a successful career.
